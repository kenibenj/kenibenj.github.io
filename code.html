                        Unlike a lot of my peers in university, my history with programming is relatively brief; the first real experience I had with coding was an intro to Python class I took in my senior year of high school - only about 3 years ago. 
                        This has its drawbacks, of course, but it does give me the unique chance to document and display my journey from a near-beginner to a full-fledged software engineer. 
                        While I obviously won't talk about every line of code I have ever written, I would like to show off some of the projects I have worked on, both academic and personal, in addition to giving brief discussions of my thoughts during and after the development cycle. 
                        A more complete list of my work can be found on my Github.

                                            'Bunker Blitz' served as the final capstone project for my computer science degree, representing my group's attempt at recreating a retro-themed tank game. 
                                            With near-complete freedom to choose our own implementation, my team of 5 had full creative control over the projects look and feel, as well as most of the gameplay decisions. 
                                            The final game boasts a multitude of features, including diverse enemy AI behavior, various power-ups for the player, and a game-progression system culminating in an epic showdown against a boss tank. 
                                            It even has customized visuals and audio!
                                            'Bunker Blitz' stands as the most comprehensive game I have contributed to.

                                            Implemented in C++, 'Bunker Blitz' marked my first real dive into lower-level languages, including concepts such as manual memory management &amp; garbage collection. 
                                            Qt, a powerful graphical user interface tool, handled the graphics and logic seamlessly, essentially transforming the game into an immensely interactive UI.

                                            My role in this project expanded significantly compared to previous group assignments from past semesters. 
                                            Not only did I contribute extensively to the design and implementation of most game features, but I also assumed the responsibility of ensuring our project aligned with the professor's expectations. 
                                            This involved coordinating meetings, maintaining email correspondence, and creating progress reports all aimed at impressing the professor with our game. 
                                            Ultimately, our efforts paid off as 'Bunker Blitz' received an A grade.

                                            The D&D Customer Management System (CMS) is an online tool meant to assist Dungeons and Dragons players create, view, and store the various characters & creatures used in their campaigns. 
                                            Developed for an informatics class in the Fall of 2022, this project was developed in order to gain skills and experience in the field of web development. 
                                            It was encouraged to create an application relevant to an interest or hobby, and as I frequently play D&D I decided to base my site around it. 
                                            The idea for a character management system was inspired by the customer managements systems used by businesses.

                                            This website is built using the ASP.NET MVC Core framework in C#. 
                                            The database is in SQL Server with the backend using ADO.NET for communication to and from the database. 
                                            The frontend makes use of Bootstrap 5 and JQuery as I wanted to gain more experience using commonly seen libraries (I had mostly used vanilla CSS and Javascript before developing this site). 
                                            The D&D CMS is hosted on an AWS server using the IIS webserver. While all of the artwork used has been modified to suit the website's needs, very little of it besides the logo is originally mine. 
                                            All artwork was edited/created in Adobe Photoshop.

                                            As its original vision has been fulfilled, the project is more or less complete and can be visited at <a href="https://dnd.kenibenj.com/">dnd.kenibenj.com</a>.
                                            in the future I may go back and add additional features &amp; content to the site.
                                            I will likely get a better domain name for the website instead of using a subdomain of my personal website should this occur.

                                            While earlier projects had given me some experience with Java GUI development in JavaFX, I still had not yet used the older and more native Swing toolkit. 
                                            In order to improve my skills in UI I watched a series of Youtube tutorials and created a simple text adventure game that introduced me to basic Java Swing concepts. 
                                            Over the next couple of months in my free-time I would make several more updated versions of the game, each with more features than the last. 
                                            This included sound effects, status indicators, shops, random-chance encounters, a basic storyline, and more. 
                                            The final version was completed shortly after the end of my Sophomore year in college, and takes roughly 15 or so minutes to complete from start to finish.

                                            At its completion this project was the one I had the most fun creating, largely because it involved a great deal of creative design and media-manipulation. 
                                            While most of the illustrations are not mine and are just simply taken from the web (this was a personal project with no monetary goals, after all), all of them are edited using Photoshop in order to fit the art style of the game. 
                                            The sound effects had to be modified as well; some of them hardly even sound like their original form anymore.

                                            Upon completing my Computer Science degree in Spring 2023, I found myself without any immediate job lined up. 
                                            I ended up having a lot of free time on my hands since my current job at the time was only part-time. 
                                            The previous Summer I had created the first iteration of this website using what little HTML and CSS I knew at the time (which also happened to be my first website ever).
                                            While I was proud of how it turned out, it was clear that there was room for significant improvement and so using my newfound free time, I took on the challenge of revamping it, incorporating the web skills I had acquired over the past year.

                                            This version of my site puts much more focus on being responsive, compared to the first iteration which was designed without any regard to its usage on mobile devices.
                                            To help with this, I utilized the Bootstrap 5 CSS framework to carry some of the workload, though the design choices I made for the site required some amount of manually-coded responsive behavior using vanilla CSS.
                                            The end result was a website that combined many of the aesthetic choices of the first iteration with a superior layout and a more mobile-friendly design.
